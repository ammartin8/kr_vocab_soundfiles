## Saving Vocab Soundfiles to CSV files
Created: 07-22-2023

Purpose: Automating a process to record korean vocab words and save them to a csv file which can then be uploaded into anki as flash cards.

#### Milestones:
- Create selenium driver and connect to appropriate website.
- Navigate website by taking a list of vocab words and do the following: input korean word in textbox then read out loud word.
- As each word is read out loud, use audacity and record on one or multiple sound file(s) (TBD which method works best).
- After words have been recorded. Tag each word in audacity.
- Save sound file(s) and export them to a folder. 
- Create list of korean words, english translation, sound tags associated with soundfile, and anki tags in a csv file (separate project; will further elaborate once we reach this milestone).
